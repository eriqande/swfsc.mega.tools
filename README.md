# swfsc.mega.tools

swfsc.mega.tools is a nascent effort to bring together bits of
R code that we have written for various applications into a single
R package that everyone in the lab should find easy to use.

Utlimately we hope that it will include functions that will assist
in a variety of analyses we do in the lab.  The several areas 
that the package addresses are detailed below.


If you have devtools installed in R, you should be able to
retrieve the version of the package here with the R command
